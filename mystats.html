    My name is Brady, I'm a big fan of gaming, whether it be tabletop games or video games. I'm a big Horror fan in both games, movies and books. My favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, my favorite movie is The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and my favorite book is The House of Leaves.
    <h1>My favorit food is Philly Cheesesteaks</h1>
    Philly Cheesesteaks are some of my favorite food because they're delicious and easy to make. I make them with peppers, but hold the mushrooms because I don't like them.
